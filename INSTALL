Prerequisites
-------------

You need those programs
  * GCC at least 4.8 (the older versions can work but we
  don't provide an official support for them
  * cmake at least 2.8 (but you can try older versions)

BareMetal OS
------------

    cd bare_cxx
    rm -f CMakeCache.txt
    mkdir ../bare.metal
    cd ../bare.metal
    cmake ../bare_cxx
    make clean
    make

Only static library is built.

There is an example program hellocpp.cpp, the make creates
hellocpp binary ready to launch on the BareMetal.

Use the instruction for BareMetal OS installation. Suppose
you have the standard (recommended) BareMetal OS tree and
put bare_cxx in the BareMetal/src folder on the same
level as a BareMetal OS, BMFS and Pure64 folders. Suppose
you created your BareMetal OS installation and installed
qemu.

To try bare c++ lib use following commnads:

    cd BareMetal
    cp src/bare.metal/hellocpp bin/hellocpp.app
    pushd bin
    bmfs bmfs.image delete hellocpp.app
    bmfs bmfs.image create hellocpp.app 3
    bmfs bmfs.image write hellocpp.app
    popd
    ./run.sh

Now you can start the hellocpp application inside the
BareMetal OS (just type `hellocpp').

Linux
-----

    cd bare_cxx
    rm -f CMakeCache.txt
    mkdir ../bare.linux
    cd ../bare.linux
    cmake -DLINUX=yes ../bare_cxx
    make clean
    make

Now you can start and debug hellocpp application and the
library itself under Linux.

The test set
------------

We use the test set from CLang libcxx library, it resides
in the test directory.
